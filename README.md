# JavaScript Tutorials ðŸš€

This repository contains my **daily JavaScript practice files**, mainly following the **Apna College Web Development Course** and other beginner-friendly resources.

## ðŸ“… Purpose
I'm uploading **one JavaScript file every day** to:
- Build daily consistency ðŸ’ª
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Track my progress visually on GitHub

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered (So Far)
Each file covers a different JavaScript concept, such as:
- Variables & Data Types
- Operators & Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays & Objects
- DOM Manipulation (coming soon)

## ðŸ”¥ Learning Journey
This is not a project repo â€” itâ€™s a personal journey of practicing raw JavaScript concepts step by step.  
I'll eventually use these concepts to build mini-projects and interactive websites!
